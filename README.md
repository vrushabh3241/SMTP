# SMTP
This project demonstrates how the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) works by using Python to send emails programmatically. The program connects to an SMTP server, authenticates the user, and sends an email to the recipient. It showcases how email transmission occurs between client and mail server, following the SMTP protocol steps.
